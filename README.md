# Diabetic Foot Analyzer 
I developed a Diabetic Foot Analyzer to help detect early signs of diabetic ulcers and prevent neuropathy. Patients can step on the device for 20 seconds daily, and it monitors temperature differences across the feet to identify potential hotspots and inflammation. Built with an Arduino, programmed in C++, and equipped with 8 thermal sensors, the Analyzer sends data to an Android app for easy tracking. Initial testing showed 85% consistency in results, highlighting its potential impact on diabetes management in Pakistan, where 20% of the population suffers from diabetes. This device aims to reduce amputations and improve quality of life for diabetics.
